      <p>Hello there, my name is Joe Santay. I'm using this page to host all my projects for<br>
         my web development class and possibly other projects in the future. I had a few main<br> 
         goals when I chose to sign up for this class. Being a Cybersecurity student, I wanted<br>
         to learn more about how websites are developed so I could better secure them. In addition<br>
         to this, I have always been interested in developing my own websites. Down below you can<br> 
         find a list of projects that I have created and which I will update as I create more.</p>
    </div>
