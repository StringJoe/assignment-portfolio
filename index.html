    <h1>This is my portfolio website</h1>

    <p id="intro">I am a student currently studying at Lewis University in Romeoville, IL<br>
                  I will be storing all the projects that I create in my web development class<br> 
                  Even after this class is finished, I will keep this site so I can continue<br>
                  showing off all the cool projects I will make in the future. Maybe in the<br>
                  future this will also end up hosting a blog as well so I can share my thoughts<br>
                  with the rest of the world and maybe someone will find them useful.</p>
